For a long time, I've wanted a fretboard diagram builder with extensive flexibility. I wanted it to work for all fretted instruments, to have a lot of customizability (so I could use it both for my own charts and for teaching), so I built one that supports:

### Features

* SVG or PNG output with size options (so it's useful in a multitude of scenarios)
* Nut support (when the position is 0, it shows the nut, otherwise it displays the position)
* Fingerings (optional, great for teaching)
* Note functions (optional, e.g. 1-3-â™­7-5)
* Root display (optional, when a note function is marked as 1, the note will be displayed as a square)
* String names (optional, great to convey the tuning or transposition of a chord, or whether the chord is in left-handed mode)
* Variable string count
* Minimum frets per diagram
* Chord catalog for Ukulele and Guitar, with chord name functions precomputed + support for transposed tunings.
* PWA with offline use

### Upcoming

* Note names from catalog
* Fix tuning enharmonics
* Mobile layout
* Diagram font fixes + fixes to alterations (â™¯â™­)
* State preservation across refreshes
* Better chord catalog selection
